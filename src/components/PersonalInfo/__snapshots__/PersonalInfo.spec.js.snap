          Morgan is the owner and founder of the (future) $1,000,000+ company Morgan Parsons Creative. She is perfectly content with potatoes for breakfast, lunch and dinner and is the 2011 Chick-fil-a Cow of the Year. Morgan is caring and always thinking about others, and I can\'t wait to get to know her more every day. She\'s also hilarious and has a firey passion of saying \"How bout dah\" on a daily basis.

          Most days you’ll find Tyler biking through the streets of Washington D.C., saving the world with code or ferociously chowing down on a Chipotle burrito the size of his head. I think I knew he was the one for me the day he asked me out… with a Chickfila sandwich. ;) #blessed.  In all seriousness, Tyler is passionate, hard working and the kindest person I know and I am excited to do life with him.
